title: Bring your parents to school day
description: "Hayden got to invite us into his class room this day. While we were there he showed us almost everything in his class room. He showed us how to sew, how to match the cats up with each other and also how to properly wash a polar bear. One of Hayden's favorite things to do in class is play with the shapes. Their were cylinders, cubes, boxes, pyramids, and a sphere."
